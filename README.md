# Awesome QA Links [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re) [![Link Checker](https://github.com/iammike/awesome-qa-links/actions/workflows/link-checker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iammike/awesome-qa-links/actions/workflows/link-checker.yml)
A curated list of blogs, articles, videos, and podcasts on software testing.

## Background
I've been in the software quality industry for more than two decades. I read a lot of blogs and try to keep up with happenings. 
A long time ago, I created a Google Doc to manage this list. In hindsight, it should have been a web page since [I run a blog](http://www.iammike.org), 
but by the time I decided to do anything about it, I realized an [Awesome repo](https://www.awesome.re) made more sense. 
Special thanks to [Awesome Testing](https://github.com/TheJambo/awesome-testing) for the inspiration and some "borrowed" boilerplate.

All links have been curated by me personally as beneficial to software testing in general or the specific work I do (a focus on iOS automation).

\* denotes an article I've written or site I maintain.
